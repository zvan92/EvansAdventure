GAME PROGRAMMING GUIDE
======================

>>>> SPAWNING GAME ITEMS

GameManager::Init():

-> Create items by creating object pointers:
example: "Food* apple = new Food();"

-> Set item properties by calling "setter" functions:
example: "apple->setName("Apple");" , "apple->setHealingFactor(5);"

-> Add item to player inventory by calling the Player object's "add item to inventory" function:
example: "Player:GetInstance()->AddItemToInventory(apple);"

-> Place item in a room by calling the MapManager's "transfer item to room" function:
example: "MapManager::GetInstance()->TransferItemToRoom(apple, "A4");"

-------------------------

>>>> CREATING ROOMS

MapManager::CreateRooms():

-> Create a room at a specific map coordinate by calling the Room constructor with extra parameters:

	Constructor format: Room(hasNorthWall, hasSouthWall, hasEastWall, hasWestWall, hasNorthDoor, hasSouthDoor, hasEastDoor, hasWestDoor)

	Constructor example: "Room(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);" 
	<1 = present, 0 = not present>

	Full example with constructor: "roomMap["A4"] = Room(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);"
	<Creates a room at map coordinate "A4" with a South wall, West wall, and North door>
